# DiscordMusicBot
This is a discord bot that I made that can play/pause/skip and many more things with music from the internet. It uses Lavalink/Wavelink and also uses Discord.py.

# How-to-use
First and foremost, this bot requires a few dependencies. In this case it requires discord.py, wavelink, and dotenv. To get these libraries, just use pip install "Library Name." If that doesn't work, try brew or whatever command line tools you may need to use.
Next, is actually running the bot, the Lavalink server will only work correctly with Java 13.0. If you do not have Java 13.0, install it and I recommend using jenv to use a different version of Java in certain directories. The documentation for jenv is very useful if you are not familiar with it.
Now, once all of that is set up, open a terminal session, make sure the java version is 13.0, and run the command 'java -jar Lavalink.' This should start the lavalink server. Next, open a new terminal session and run python3 main.py. Now you have the music bot running. All you have to do, is add the bot to your server and it should star working!
